# Vitamin-Deficiency-
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that detects vitamin deficiencies (such as Vitamin A, B, C, D, or E) by analyzing a user's skin image. By leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques, the system identifies visible signs of deficiencies reflected through the user's skin type and condition.

A custom dataset is used, consisting of labeled skin images categorized by specific vitamin deficiencies. The model is trained to recognize patterns and symptoms associated with each deficiency.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to upload their skin image, which is then analyzed by the trained model to predict the most probable vitamin deficiency. The goal is to provide an accessible health screening tool that helps in early detection and awareness.
